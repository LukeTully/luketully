I'm a software developer (mostly frontend) based out of beautiful Vancouver, BC on the west coast of Canada, where I spend as much of my free time as I can in the outdoors 🌱, skateboarding 🛹, or bouldering with friends.

#### Lately I'm interested in...
- The process of improvement through repitition and refinement
- Performance and true iterative process in software development
- Data visualization and design

### What I’m Learning 🎒
- To build a modern computer from scratch, currently implementing a VM Translator as part of the [Nand2Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), and  [The Elements of Computer Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/ref=ed_oe_p)
- Swift/SwiftUI

### What I’m currently working on (2024) 👨🏼‍💻
- Building a personal productivity tool as a native macOS app, using Swift and SwiftUI, for people who work on teams and use Git, GitHub, and Jira
- Working on a few articles that detail the process of migrating from Angular.js to React and TypeScript


### I’m looking for work!
As either an independent contractor, or full-time employee, I’m looking to bring my skills as a frontend developer to your team or business. 
#### I’d bring with me the following non-exhaustive list of skills, experiences, and other ways I’d be able to add value 
> I’d be expecting that at the right place (as an employee) there would be the option or expectation to continually grow and add to the list
##### I have professional/technical experience with…
- Contributing to large typed or untyped, JavaScript and Python codebases
- Improving test coverage by designing and implementing automated integration and unit tests in Jest using [testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/), [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), [puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), and incorporating dependency injection principles into the design of previously tightly-coupled controllers or components
- Designing and implementing responsive layouts with CSS grid and flexbox, often using SCSS or native CSS nesting and variable capabilities
- Configuring Webpack, Typescript, Vite, build systems, and some legacy taskrunners such as Grunt and Gulp
- Refactoring complex untyped JavaScript/Angular.js code to React with TypeScript
- Getting up to speed quickly with new APIs or tools in general and evaluating them for use
- Debugging obscure issues reported by customers and delivering fixes
- Implementing features to an agreed upon published spec/protocol for the purpose of interoperability with other applications

##### 	and less-technical experience with…
- Collaborating with widely distributed colleagues, while…
  - having my code reviewed by them
  - reviewing their changes and offering feedback
  - solving problems in an async or sync context (Jira, Slack, Zoom) depending on the nature and complexity of the discussion
- Mentoring junior colleagues and helping onboard new colleagues
- Being a temporary lead in an Agile team
- Fostering an environment where people feel valued and comfortable openly communicating
- Navigating stressful periods of uncertainty and recovering from burnout
